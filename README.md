## Mobile apps developers
If you are developing against a branch of `mobile-apps-article-templates` which is not `master`:

# Building locally
* Checkout the branch you are developing against
* Run `yarn build`
* Edit the `package.json` file in the root of `ios-live` /`android-news-app`, replacing the version of the `@guardian/mobile-apps-article-templates` dependency with the relative path of the local templates repo, e.g. (if your repositories are in the same folder):
```
"dependencies": {
    "@guardian/mobile-apps-article-templates": "file:../mobile-apps-article-templates"
}
```

Next time you build the app it will use the currently checked-out branch of `mobile-apps-article-templates`

# Building from s3
* Find the branch you want to test on [teamCity](https://teamcity.gutools.co.uk/viewType.html?buildTypeId=Apps_Templates_TemplatesS3v2)
* Click run to build the branch and upload to s3
* You can find the s3 package in `bundle-url.txt` under `artifacts`

Update your package.json:
```
"dependencies": {
    "@guardian/mobile-apps-article-templates": "https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/builds.gutools.co.uk/guardian-mobile-apps-article-templates-v1.0.190.tgz"
}
```

## Yarn scripts
Yarn will provide the following services:

* `yarn test` runs the JS unit tests from the `test/spec/unit/` directory
* `yarn build` builds JS/CSS assets, used on CI environment for building assets
* `yarn dev` builds JS and CSS (with source maps).
