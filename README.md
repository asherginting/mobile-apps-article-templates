## Mobile apps developers
If you are developing against a branch of `mobile-apps-article-templates` which is not `master`:

# Building locally iOS
* Checkout the branch you are developing against
* Run `npm run build`
* Edit the `package.json` file in the root of `ios-live`, replacing the version of the `@guardian/mobile-apps-article-templates` dependency with the relative path of the local templates repo:

```
"dependencies": {
    "@guardian/mobile-apps-article-templates": "file:../mobile-apps-article-templates"
}
```

Next time you build the app it will use the currently checked-out branch of `mobile-apps-article-templates`

# Building locally Android
* Checkout the branch you are developing against
* Run `npm run build`
* Edit the `package.json` file in `android-news-app/android-news-app/`, replacing the version of the `@guardian/mobile-apps-article-templates` dependency with the relative path of the local templates repo:

```
"dependencies": {
    "@guardian/mobile-apps-article-templates": "../../mobile-apps-article-templates"
}
```

# Building from s3
* Find the branch you want to test on [teamCity](https://teamcity.gutools.co.uk/viewType.html?buildTypeId=Apps_Templates_TemplatesS3v2)
* Click run to build the branch and upload to s3
* You can find the s3 package in `bundle-url.txt` under `artifacts`
