# How to release your changes

1. Locally make sure you have an up to date `master` and `release` branch
2. Merge master into release and push up that branch
3. Cicle CI is listening to the release branch and will run test and build the branch
4. If the Cicle CI build is successful, it merges release back into master with the updated build files.
